This is a simple RaspberryPi application written in c demonstrating the Sensirion SHT3x temperature/humidity sensor.

The project is based on the Sensirion / embedded-sht library: https://github.com/Sensirion/embedded-sht.git

The application is stripped down to the bare minimum however to make it more managable and easy to understand.
